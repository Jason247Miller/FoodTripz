# FoodTripz
Senior project 
This project aims to provide an interface of communication between Food Donors and those who are in need of Food. 
The project is written in ASP.NET WEb Forms which provides a Google Maps API to display all local Food Donors. 

A Food Recipient can click on a marker and and go to the Donors Public Page where all availble products are displayed along with their pick up times.
